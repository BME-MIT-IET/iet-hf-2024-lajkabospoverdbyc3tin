### Project Goal

The goal of our project, "Sivatagi Vizhalozatok" (Desert Water Networks), is to create a strategic game where players take on the roles of mechanics or saboteurs. Mechanics aim to construct and maintain a water supply network in a desert, while saboteurs strive to disrupt and damage the network. The game involves managing various elements such as player roles, field and pipe interactions, and incorporates debugging and logging systems.

This project allows us to practice and apply techniques like code analysis, testing, and continuous integration on a real-world application. Through this project, we will enhance our understanding of software quality and improve the application's robustness and functionality.
